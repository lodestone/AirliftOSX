AirliftOSX
==========

A preliminary OS X client for [Airlift](https://github.com/moshee/airlift), the self-hosted file upload and sharing service. The current implementation "just works" -- words that come to mind are *basic*, *bare-bones*, *buggy*, and *baffling*.

A binary download may be found under the [releases tab](https://github.com/moshee/AirliftOSX/releases).

### Usage

Launch the app and the icon should show up in your menu bar.

![Menu item](https://i.ktkr.us/t5xw)

Clicking on it should allow you to access the preferences; here, you need to set up the host, port, and password for your server.

Then, you can drag files onto the icon, use `Opt+Shift+4` to capture and upload a screenshot with the familiar screencapture interface, or `Opt+Shift+3` to upload a shot of the entire screen.
